[What would make a website agent-friendly?](https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1931241984645103871)

Goal: Something similar to https://www.opengraph.xyz and https://pagespeed.web.dev but not for og-image or page speed, but for agent-friendliness.

Results are cached and shareable publicly. Doing new ones require X login. Small badge is also created, able to be added to website and github repo. Also bigger image would be nice to add to repo or website that actually has all scores in it.
